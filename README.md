# 3D Cellular Automaton Visualizer

## Background
With my love for beautiful art, and a amalgamations of colors that just blend and work together. Coupled With a 3d visualizer I can use the power of color and moving cellular automatons to cast a beautiful display of dynamic action! I’ve always been interested in creating my own 3d visualizer for algorithms and cellular automaton. There's dozens of examples online and the one thing they lack is color and creativity. Most of these projects aren’t interactive and the creators don’t have live links to test them out. My project will be loosely related to Conway's game of life but with slight variations to fit 3D space. First it will be in 3D so no more boring and bland 2D grids displaying the automatons.

## Functionality & MVP
A 3d cellular automata visualizer using ThreeJs for 3d functionality in the browser, and a started set of rules similar to Conway's game of life but adjusted to the three dimensional nature that each cell will now have 26 neighbors to account for. Users can then use sliders to change the settings and see the patterns generated by those settings. I can also have a starter set of patterns visible for users to click on and select. 

- On each cycle, the grid will self assess each cell and check to see if it has a minimum of 2 or 3 neighbors on that cell. ( Will have to see once it’s working to see if these numbers are good enough since we go from 8 direct neighbors in 2D space to 26 direct neighbors in 3D space)
- The next cycle grid will be generated based on the previous cycle’s configuration.
Once one cell checks if it meets its dead or alive rule set it will return a true or false value.
- The 3D grid renderer will also allow user to change the settings.

## User Interactional Functionality - User will be able to:
- Set initial size of the 3d grid using a slider that will have a predetermined min-max grid sizes
- Select from a set of initial states ( Will need to play around to find good configurations since I know the 3d nature will affect how each cell now interacts with the other)
- Select configuration rule set. Edit how many neighbors it needs to stay alive or how many neighbors it needs to revive.
- Will be able to choose a preset of colorful themes. The theme will be applied to living cell based on it's living neighbor count. (BONUS) Depending on how far away other cells that are alive, the dead cell can show a “possibility” for revival. Color will be alight red hue that would need to be calculated with the grid system.

## Extras
- A modal introducing my variation of cellular automata with Instructions on using the UI for the user
- A production README
## Architecture and Technologies
The 3d visualizer will be implemented using the collection of the following technologies:
-   Javascript implement algorithm logic
-  HTML & CSS - Used for site functionality and give users interactivity to the visualizer
-   Three.js implement grid and cell rendering, and also allow us to add interactivity to the visualizer so users can click on dropdowns and sliders. ( Bonus goals will be to add ability to use the mouse to move the direction the camera moves around the clusters and cells ) 
-   Webpack used bundle our three

## Wireframes
The visualizer will consist of a main view. Once the 3D assets are loaded onto the users client, the main view will display a 3d viewport. On the left will be the cellular automaton editor settings. Users can choose starting grid size, cell clusters, and ability to choose predefined initial state.
On the right side users will have 3D controls available to rotate the camera manually or they can use mouse input to rotate and zoom in as well. At the bottom right users will be able to choose preset color themes.

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1
    -   Have project file structure and webpack configured to run with Three.js
    -   Learn enough of the Three.js library to display a grid of cubes with a camera rotatings around them
### Day 2
    - Will be taking this day to flesh out the grid rendering algorithm. 
    - Build out the class structure and functionality
    - Learn how to intergrate the browser functionality with Three.js to start creating the UI/UX for users
### Day 3
    - Code in the automaton rule set. Start testing out different patterns and see the cells interact.
    - Formulate 3 patterns that will be showcased on the main site
    - Start styling the main site and complete the instructional modal for users
### Day 4
    - Polish the viewport controls
    - Fix and permorfance bugs encoured while programming with Three.js
### Beyond
    - Will continue this project providing incremental changes as time goes on.
